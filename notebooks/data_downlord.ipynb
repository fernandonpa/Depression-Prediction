    "The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was gathered through a broad survey designed to explore the various factors influencing depression risk in adults. Conducted anonymously from January to June 2023, the survey spanned multiple cities, including individuals from diverse professional and demographic backgrounds. Participants, aged between 18 and 60, willingly shared information on factors like age, gender, location, education, job satisfaction, study/work hours, and family medical history, among other aspects. No professional mental health evaluations or diagnostic tests were involved.\n",

    "The primary variable, 'Depression', indicates whether an individual is at risk of depression, with 'Yes' or 'No' responses based on lifestyle and demographic inputs. The dataset is intended to help identify how everyday factors could be linked to mental health risks, making it a valuable resource for developing machine learning models focused on predicting mental health outcomes.\n",
